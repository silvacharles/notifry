Rather than using SMS to send notifications from your Nagios or other monitoring system, use the push notifications on modern Android phones.

This saves money as SMS can cost money to send, and also allows better handling of notifications on the phone, rather than it clogging up your SMS application with messages.

Messages are designed to be short term only, and the phone will delete them periodically to free space.
