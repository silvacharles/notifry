What is Notifry?
Notifry is a push notification service to send server notifications to Android Mobile phones, running Android 2.2 or later. It uses Google's Android Cloud to Device Messaging APIs.
It is intended to replace notifications sent by SMS. SMS cost money to send, and for single user applications (like personal Nagios servers) this can give you real time notifications for free.
Unlike other systems that do the server monitoring for you, Notifry is just intended to get the message to the phone - and no more. Notifry is meant to be very simple and just focus on getting the notifications to the phone. You can plug Notifry into your existing monitoring system to get the notifications going. Users supply the system administrators with a single unique key that identifies at message source, which they can enable or disable at will.


# Shutdown on June 6th, 2013
Notifry has been running as a free service since it was created in 2011. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to properly maintain Notifry for the future. So I have made the difficult decision to shut it down on June 6th, 2013.
There are other alternatives out there that do what Notifry does.
Thankyou for your support over the years.
