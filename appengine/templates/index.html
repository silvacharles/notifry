<h1>When is Notifry going to be released?</h1>

<p>Notifry is planned for general release at the end of May 2011. Until that time, it is still in closed BETA test.</p>

<h1>What is Notifry?</h1>

<p>Notifry is a push notification service to send server notifications to Android
Mobile phones, running Android 2.2 or later. It uses Google's Android Cloud to Device
Messaging APIs.</p>

<p>It is intended to replace notifications sent by SMS. SMS cost money to send,
and for single user applications (like personal Nagios servers) this can give you
real time notifications for free.</p>

<p>Unlike other systems that do the server monitoring for you, Notifry is just
intended to get the message to the phone - and no more. Notifry is meant to be
very simple and just focus on getting the notifications to the phone. You can
plug Notifry into your existing monitoring system to get the notifications
going. Users supply the system administrators with a single unique key that
identifies at message source, which they can enable or disable at will.</p>

<h2>How much and where do I get it?</h2>

<p>Notifry is free, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/notifry">all the code is available</a> under the Apache 2 License.</p>
